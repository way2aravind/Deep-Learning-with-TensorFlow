## Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where neural networks with many layers learn from vast amounts of data. This project uses TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, to build, train, and evaluate neural networks. Youâ€™ll learn to work with data, preprocess it, and build models for tasks like classification.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the code:

1. **Install TensorFlow**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
   - Install TensorFlow using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow
     ```
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/way2aravind/Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow.git
